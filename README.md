**This repo demonstrates using various Deep RL Models to solve the classic control problem "CartPole".**

- In progress! More implementations will be added, including the Model-based methods. 
- For the sake of better demonstrating the workflow, the codes here are not the most efficient. (o_o) Can you improve? 
- Regarding the theory of RL, please consult with my book project [PDF](https://www.easonspace.com/book). <br>
